# homebrew-egovframe

## Introduction
The `homebrew-egovframe` repository was initiated in response to the challenges encountered in the `homebrew-cask` repository. macOS on ARM mandates that software be signed. As of now, the upstream developer has not yet signed and notarized their software. This repository serves as a temporary solution until that process is complete. Once the software is signed and notarized, users will be able to install it directly from the `homebrew-cask` repository.
